Greetings,

I’m Shahzeb, a third-year Computer Science student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. With a strong background in Full Stack development (MERN) and Next.js, I’m interested in exploring a 2-3 month paid internship at [COMPANY].

I’m really interested in the work your [TYPE] is doing and would be thrilled to contribute. If there’s a possibility to discuss this further, I’d be happy to chat about how I can help.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response!

Best regards,
Shahzeb Akhtar
