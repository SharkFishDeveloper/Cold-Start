Greetings ,
I’m Shahzeb, a third-year student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology pursuing Computer Science. I’m a skilled coder with experience in Full stack(MERN) and Nextjs, and I’m interested in a 2-3 month paid internship at your [COMPANY].

I admire the innovative work your [TYPE] is doing, and I’d love the chance to contribute while gaining hands-on experience. Please let me know if we could discuss this further.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
Shahzeb Akhtar
