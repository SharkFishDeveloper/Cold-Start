Hi ,

I’m Shahzeb, a third-year student from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, majoring in Computer Science. I have experience with Full Stack development (MERN) and Next.js and am looking for a 2-3 month paid internship at [COMPANY].

I’ve been following the impressive work your [TYPE] is doing and would be excited about the chance to contribute. I’d be grateful if we could discuss any available internship opportunities and how I might fit into your team.

Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear from you soon!

Best regards,
Shahzeb Akhtar
