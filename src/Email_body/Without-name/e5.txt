Hello ,

My name is Shahzeb, and I’m currently in my third year studying Computer Science at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. I have hands-on experience with Full Stack development (MERN) and Next.js, and I’m looking for a 2-3 month paid internship at [COMPANY].

I’m really impressed by the work your [TYPE] is doing and would be thrilled to contribute to your team. I’d love to discuss any available opportunities and see how I can be a valuable addition.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Shahzeb Akhtar
