Hi [Name],

I’m Shahzeb, a third-year Computer Science student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology. With hands-on experience in Full Stack development (MERN) and Next.js, I’m eager to apply my skills and explore a 2-3 month paid internship opportunity at [COMPANY].

I’m impressed by the forward-thinking approach your [TYPE] has shown, and I’m excited about the possibility of contributing to your team. If there’s a chance we could discuss this further, I’d love to connect!

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Shahzeb Akhtar
